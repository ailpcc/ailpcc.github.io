Hey! My name is Cheno Mumu Abbreviation: Mumu (in Chinese)
This website is only for personal development or for learning WEB or testing functions or for easy sharing.
The website is written from a personal point of view (insufficient staff + not enough energy), naturally some strange bugs.
I like to play Sky: Children of the Light so the background was someone who used sky: Children of the Light (I don't know who drew this, it's beautiful).
At present, there are no new plans for typesetting, but I feel that my own interface is already very good-looking.
If there is a copyright problem please contact me, I will delete it within a period of time (if the problem is serious)
At present, the most developed ones are EEW and diary
Thank you for understanding and always believe that good things are about to happen!
